This directory contains tests of the file management system (fopen1)
and parser components (wordtest, kvtest, argtest, pstest,
partest). All tests function as usual - output should be identical to
reference, as recorded in summary.rpt - except for the file management
test (fopen1). Since part of this test generates unique random
filenames for temp files, the test output CANNOT be identical to that
of the reference run (data file fopen.rpt_ref). The user will need to
inspect the two files to see that, except for filenames, the two are
the same, that is, precisely the same file manipulations took place.

The implication for a regression framework is that the "failure" of
this test should be noted but generally ignored.
