          *** IWAVE installation of SU library routines ***

IWAVE relies on a subset extracted from the Seismic Unix utility
library. This (self-contained) sublibrary is the sucore
package. Seismic Unix is intellectual property of the Colorado School
of Mines, and is made available under a license described in the
LEGAL_STATEMENT included in the sucore root directory.

SU utilities perform i/o in either native binary or XDR format. The
IWAVE sublibrary (sucore package) installs either with or without the
XDR option, depending on whether the SUXDR flag is passed as a -D 
option to the compiler/linker. This option is part of the OCFLAGS 
macro set in the compiler config file (seamx/admin/rules/
Prg.defs.$PROJARCH.$COMP).
