Madagascar - Package for reproducible geophysical data processing

What is madagascar
==================
Madagascar is an open-source software package for geophysical data
processing and reproducible numerical experiments. Its mission is to
provide

    * a convenient and powerful environment
    * a convenient technology transfer tool 

for researchers working with digital image and data processing. The
technology developed using the Madagascar project management system is
transferred in the form of recorded processing histories, which become
"computational recipes" to be verified, exchanged, and modified by
users of the system.

History
=======
While being written from scratch, madagascar borrows ideas from the
design of SEPlib, a publicly available software package, maintained by
Bob Clapp at the Stanford Exploration Project (SEP). Generations of
SEP students and researchers contributed to SEPlib. Most important
contributions came from Rob Clayton, Jon Claerbout, Dave Hale, Stew
Levin, Rick Ottolini, Joe Dellinger, Steve Cole, Dave Nichols, Martin
Karrenbach, Biondo Biondi, and Bob Clapp.

Madagascar was started, under the name RSF (Regularly Sampled Format)
by Sergey Fomel in 2003. Since then, several other people have
contributed to it. See the AUTHORS.txt file for an incomplete list.
