BUG FIXES:

In the reproducible documents collection:
* Cross-platform (Linux/Mac) solution in book/jsg/flat/*/SConstruct
* Fixed program links in book/bei/fdm and book/bei/ft1

In documentation:
* Update of html/txt/spec documentation and man pages triggered by
  changes in programs or examples through dependence on use.py
* Show y and n for boolean parameters in F90 programs, instead of .true./.false.
* Show y and n for boolean params in some Python programs instead of True/False
    (fix for some cases in which existing mechanism did not work) 

In APIs:
* Appropriate flags for compilation on OpenSolaris
* Fixed memory leak in getpar.c
* Fixed memory leak in llist.c
* Improved accuracy of triangle smoothing
* Updated numpy interface in m8r.i

In the Python package:
