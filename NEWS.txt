===Bug fixes===

In the reproducible documents collection:
* Cross-platform (Linux/Mac) solution in book/jsg/flat/*/SConstruct
* Fixed program links in book/bei/fdm and book/bei/ft1
* Fixed program links in book/gee/ajt and book/gee/hlx
* High-resolution figures in book/gee/hlx

In documentation:
* Update of html/txt/spec documentation and man pages triggered by changes in programs or examples through dependence on use.py
* Show y and n for boolean parameters in F90 programs, instead of .true./.false.
* Show y and n for boolean params in some Python programs instead of True/False
    (fix for some cases in which existing mechanism did not work) 

In APIs:
* Appropriate flags for compilation on OpenSolaris
* Fixed memory leak in getpar.c
* Fixed memory leak in llist.c
* Improved accuracy of triangle smoothing
* Updated numpy interface in m8r.i

In the Python package:
* In rsf.user.ivlad (function ndims)
* In rsf.user.ooio (init of class RSFheader)
* CUDA configuration moved to configure.py

In programs:
* sfbandpass
* sfzcp
* sfstretch - proper handling of half-offset
* sfslant and sfvelcon - proper antialiasing

==About this document==
This document is found both as a wiki page at http://m8r.info/wiki/Release_Notes , and under source version control (SVN) at https://rsf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rsf/trunk/NEWS.txt . The SVN version is the definitive one. Before a release, the content of the latest section of the wiki page and that of the corresponding part of NEWS.txt should be reconciled.
