Prerequisites
=============

   1. C compiler. ANSI-compliant compiler such as GCC should work. GCC
usually comes pre-installed on Linux machines.

   2. Python interpreter. Python is an interpretable programming
language. It is used by RSF in installation scripts and project
management scripts. Python is pre-installed on some versions of Linux.

Environmental variables
=======================

   1.  Set the RSFROOT environmental variable to the directory where
you want RSF installed.

   2. Set the PYTHONPATH environmental variable to include
$RSFROOT/lib.

   3. Add $RSFROOT/bin to your PATH environmental variable.

   4. Set DATAPATH to the directory for temporary data files.

Example configuration for csh and tcsh:

setenv RSFROOT /usr/local/rsf
if ($?PYTHONPATH) then
   setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:$RSFROOT/lib
else
   setenv PYTHONPATH $RSFROOT/lib
endif
set path = ($path $RSFROOT/bin)
setenv DATAPATH /var/tmp/

Example configuration for bash:

export RSFROOT=/usr/local/rsf
if [ -n "$PYTHONPATH" ]; then
   export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$RSFROOT/lib
else
   export PYTHONPATH=$RSFROOT/lib
fi
export PATH=$PATH:$RSFROOT/bin
export DATAPATH=/var/tmp/

Notice the slash at the end of the DATAPATH variable.

Software construction
=====================

   1. Configuration.

      Change to the top RSF source directory and run

      ./configure

      You can examine the config.py file that this command
generates. Additional options are available. You can obtain a full
list of customizable variables by running "scons -h". For example, to
install C++ and Fortran-90 API bindings in addition to the basic
package, run

      ./configure API=c++,fortran-90

   2. Building and installing the package.

      Run "make install" or the following two commands in succession:

      make 
      make install

      If you need "root" privileges for installing under $RSFROOT,
you may need to run

      make
      su
      make install

      or

      make
      sudo make install

   3. Cleaning.

      To clean all intermediate files generated by SCons, run

      make clean

      To clean all intermediate files and all installed files, run

      make distclean
