TRIP software installs as part of a global Madagascar install, with
the standard conventions - commands begin with "sf..." and install in
the Madagascar bin directory defined at configuration.

It is also possible to build the TRIP packages locally, either all of
them together by executing "scons" in this directory, or individually
by executing "scons" in the package root (iwave, rvl,...).

As with other Madagascar packages, default options for local build are 
-g, no optimization.

To build with other options (higher optimization level, MPI, ...)
create a file named config.py defining these options, after the
fashion of the RSFSRC/config.py file. Note that only C/C++ related 
options are relevant. The admin subdirectory contains several examples.

More control is possible by building at the package level, including
creation of documentation and testing. Please see the TRIP software
web page (www.trip.caam.rice.edu/software/software.html) for more
details.
