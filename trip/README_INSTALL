      *** Installation of TRIP Software in Madagascar ***

1. Global Install

TRIP software installs as part of a global Madagascar install, with
the standard conventions - commands begin with "sf..." and move to
the Madagascar bin directory defined at configuration.

An important example of a non-default configuration is MPI-enabled
installation. See the variant of the configure command in
RSFSRC/trip/admin/mpiconfig. You can edit this file for appropriate
paths to the Madagascar install directory and the MPI compiler
wrappers, and source it to set up an MPI build.

2. Local install

It is also possible to build the TRIP packages locally, either all of
them together by executing "scons" in this directory, or individually
by executing "scons" in the package root (iwave, rvl,...). Locally
built executables are stored with their source in main subdirs, with
suffix .x.

Default options for local build are -g and no optimization.

To build with other options (higher optimization level, MPI, ...)
create a file named config.py defining these options, after the
fashion of the RSFSRC/config.py file. Note that only C/C++ related 
options are relevant. The admin subdirectory contains several examples.

Place config.py in this directory (i.e. in RSFSRC/trip), then scons.

More control is possible by building at the package level, including
creation of documentation and testing. Please see the TRIP software
web page (www.trip.caam.rice.edu/software/software.html) for more
details.
