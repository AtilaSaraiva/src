\plot{data5m}{width=15cm}{2D shot record, (2,4) staggered grid scheme, $\Delta x = \Delta z =$ 5 m,
  appropriate $\Delta t$, 301 traces: shot x = 3300 m, shot z = 40 m, receiver x =
 100 - 6100 m, receiver z = 20 m, number of time samples = 1501, time

\plot{trace}{width=15cm}{Trace 100 (receiver x = 2100 m) for $\Delta x = \Delta z = $
 20 m (red), 10 m (green), 5 m (blue), and 2.5 m (black). Note
 arrival time discrepancy after 1 s: this is the interface error
 discussed in \cite[]{SymesVdovina:09}. Except for the 20 m result,
 grid dispersion error is minimal.} 

\plot{wtrace}{width=15cm}{Trace 100 detail, 1.8-2.5 s, showing more clearly the
 first-order interface error: the time shift between computed events
 and the truth (the 2.5 m result, more or less) is proportional to
 $\Delta t$, or equivalently to $\Delta z$.}

Comparing to Figure \ref{fig:wtrace}, notice that the dispersion error for
the 20 m grid is considerably smaller, but the results for finer grids
are nearly identical to those produced by the (2,4) grids - almost all
of the remaining error is due to the presence of discontinuities in
the model.}
