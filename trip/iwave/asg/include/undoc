<li>
Movie output. To create movies of pressure and velocity fields specify 
the following parameters:
<ul>
  <li>makemovie    = <int> [Default: 0] - movie flag; 0 - no movie output, 1 - make movies</li>
  <li>movieaxis3D  = <int>   - 2D slice orthogonal to this axis is stored</li>
  <li>movieslice3D = <int>   - index of the 2D slice along movieaxis3D to store</li>
  <li>moviestep    = <float> - time interval at which movie frames are stored</li>
</ul>
Notes:
<ul>
  <li>In case of 3D simulations 2D slices of wavefields are stored into movies.</li>
  <li>Time interval to store movie frames is adjusted to fit time steps.</li>
  <li>Currently movies are stored by each MPI process to a separate file whose name contains MPI rank.</li>
</ul>
