This file describes the procedure for re-compiling the extended abstract 
entitled "Shortest path ray tracing on parallel GPU devices" including 
re-computing all figures contained therein.  

Pre-requisites for building the manuscript:

1) Madagascar software package has been installed and all user-submitted 
   codes have been compiled and installed.

2) An up-to-date LaTeX distribution has been installed.

3) Our manuscript relies on the segabs.cls, seg.sty and seg.bst LaTeX 
   class file which can be obtained from the SEGTeX package for 
   geophysical publications (http://www.ahay.org/wiki/SEGTeX). (We 
   provide this files). It also uses LaTeX pacakges algorithm.sty and
   algorithmic.sty that you have to obtain from a LaTeX repository 
   (http://www.ctan.org) if your current LaTeX distribution doesn't
   come with them.


To build the extended abstract:

1) Execute the command 'sftour scons lock' to initiate the computation 
   of the necessary figures contained in the manuscript.  

2) Execute the command 'scons segabs_graphrayt.pdf' to compile the pdf 
   version of the manuscript

The compiled manuscript can be found in the file segabs_graphrayt.pdf
