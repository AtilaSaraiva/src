\section{Introduction}
\inputdir{rain}

In 1997, the European Communities organized a Spatial Interpolation
Comparison. Many different organizations participated with the results
published in a special issue of the \emph{Journal of Geographic
Information and Decision Analysis} \cite[]{dubois} and a separate
report \cite[]{rain}.

The comparison used a dataset from rainfall measurements in
Switzerland on the 8th of May 1986, the day of the Chernobyl disaster.
Figure~\ref{fig:elev} shows the data area: the Digital Elevation Model
of Switzerland with superimposed country's borders.  A total of 467
rainfall measurements were taken that day. A randomly selected subset
of 100 measurements was used as the input data the 1997 Spatial
Interpolation Comparison in order to interpolate other measurements
using different techniques and to compare the results with the known
data. Figure~\ref{fig:raindata} shows the spatial locations of the
selected data samples and the full dataset.

  used as input data in the spatial interpolation contest.  Right: all
  weather stations locations.}

Many different spatial interpolation techniques have been tried on
this dataset \cite[]{dubois,Fomel.sepphd.107}. For simplicity, I
present here only one the result of simple Delaunay triangulation with
linear interpolation of rainfall values inside each triangle. The
interpolation result is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:trian}. Figure~\ref{fig:pred} provides a comparison
between interpolated and known data values. It also indicates the
value of the correlation coefficient.
