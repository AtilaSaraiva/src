\section{Introduction}

The goal of this paper is to introduce the \textsc{Madagascar}
software package. \textsc{Madagascar} provides a collection of
programs for multidimensional data analysis, including seismic imaging
and seismic data processing, and an integrated environment for
conducting data processing workflows and computational experiments.

It is the need for an integrated and open environment for geophysical
research that motivated the development of
\textsc{Madagascar}... reproducible research... ..similarities and
differences with MATLAB... with SU...

The paper is organized as follows. We start with basic facts about the
\textsc{Madagascar} development status and organizational
structure. Next, we describe the core principles that went into
software design. Finally, we provide guidelines for new users for
exploring the package and for contributing new software to it. The
appendix contains a complete example of a small research project
implemented in \textsc{Madagascar}

\section{Facts}

The work on the \textsc{Madagascar} package (previously named RSF for
\emph{Regularly Sampled Format}) started in 2003.  The package got
publicly released during an EAGE Workshop on open-source E\&P Software
in Vienna in June 2006. Since then, more than 25 people have
contributed to its development, writing more than 250,000 lines of
code.

\href{http://www.ohloh.net/}{Ohloh}, a website that maps the landscape
of open-source software development, evaluates \textsc{Madagascar} as
\begin{itemize}
\item Mature, well-established codebase
\item Increasing year-over-year development activity
\item Large, active development team 
\end{itemize}

Several events helped promote \textsc{Madagascar} in the geophysical
and signal processing communities:
\begin{description}
\item[2006 School and Workshop on Reproducible Research in
  Computational Geophysics] took place in Vancouver, Canada, and
  attracted...
\item[2007 Short Course on Using and Extending Madagascar] took place
  in Austin, Texas, and attracted...
\item[2008 Implementation Workshop] took place in Golden, Colorado, attracted...
\item[2009 School on Reproducible Computational Geophysics] took place
  in Delft, the Netherlands, and attracted...
\item[2009 Madagascar Tutorial] took place in Salvador, Brazil, and attracted...
\item[2010 MadagascarFest] is planning to take place in Houston, Texas.
\end{description}

\section{Design principles}

The design of \textsc{Madagascar} is based on several fundamental
principles. 

One of the principles is \emph{modularity} and
\emph{encapsulation}. Similarly to Seismic Unix \cite[]{TLE16-07-10451049},
the core of \textsc{Madagascar} consists of a collection of separate
modules, connected in data analysis workflows...

\emph{reproducible research} and \emph{test-driven development}.

\section{How to find your way around \textsc{Madagascar}}

An easy way to start exploring \textsc{Madagascar} is checking the
list of reproducible papers at
\url{http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Reproducible_Documents}.  If any of
these papers looks close to your interests, follow the links until you
find a figure with a "wrench" button under it. Click on the wrench,
and it will open a computational recipe used for generating the figure
(the \texttt{SConstruct} file). Here is an simple
example\footnote{\url{http://www.reproducibility.org/RSF/book/rsf/rsf/sfmath.html}}:

\section{How to contribute your own programs to \textsc{Madagascar}}

The \textsc{Madagascar} community is open. Developers take a joint
responsibility of maintaining and extending the package. It is easy to
become a developer:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Follow the Guide on Adding new programs to Madagascar.
\item  If your employer holds the copyright for your software, obtain a permission to distribute under a GPL license and place a copyright and GPL license notice in each file with code.
\item Register at SourceForge.
\item Find out who the current project administrators are and pass your SourceForge user name to one of them.
\item Upload your directory to the Subversion repository at SourceForge.
\item Make sure to add reproducible examples of using your program. As a rule, programs without examples are not included in the release version. 
\end{enumerate}
