\section{Introduction}
The "Amoco" dataset found within the \emph{RSF} repository was created in 1997 and presented formally at the talk \emph{Strike shooting, dip shooting, widepatch shooting -- Does prestack migration care? A model study'} given by John Etgen and Carl Regone at the 1998 SEG convention.

\section{Model}
The velocity model was described by it's creator :
\inputdir{model}
%\plot{velmodel}{width=\textwidth}{Amoco velocity model}
%\plot{velsmooth}{width=\textwidth}{Amoco smoothed velocity model}
\multiplot{2}{velmodel,velsmooth}{width=.45\textwidth}{Amoco velocity models.}
