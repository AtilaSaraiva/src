Outline of directories in teapotdome:

MAIN tah PROCESSING
+++++++++++++++++++
$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/fetch
	scons in this directory will download data and run sfsegyread

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahnmostack
	apply nmo and stack of the preprocessed gathers downloaded in the 
	../fetch directory.  This stack is dompared to the stack created 
	using seismic unix, SU.  THis directory also displays some of the 
	midpoint gathers from the processed gathers with and without nmo.
	Fold plots, a shot location map, and a receiver location map are 
	displayed.  The a few of the unprocessed shot records dowloaded 
	in the fetch directory are displayed with and without nmo.  
	sftahsort is used to sort a few unprocessed midpoint gathers for
	comparison with the processed migpoint gathers.

Perhaps the tahnmostack scsonstruct whould be divided.  The geometry qc
	can be moved into a seperate directory.  Perhaps this directory
	is was Vladimir already created.  May also move other portions,
	like qc and preprocessint the npr3_field.rsf, into another direcory.

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahscscale
	apply surface consistant scaling to npr3_field.rsf

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/nmostack
	seismic unix scripts to apply nmo and stack the prestack processed
	data.

I need to index other work previous done by Vladimir.  Zomig can also be
       indexed in this readme file
