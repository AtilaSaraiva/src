Outline of directories in teapotdome:

MAIN tah PROCESSING
+++++++++++++++++++
$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/fetch
	scons in this directory will download data and run sfsegyread

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/geom
	basic fold plots and shot/group maps

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/vels
 	interpolate velocity (not used yet in later directories)

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahnmostack
	apply nmo and stack of the preprocessed gathers downloaded in the 
	../fetch directory.  This stack is dompared to the stack created 
	using seismic unix, SU.  This directory also displays some of the 
	midpoint gathers from the processed gathers with and without nmo.
	A few of the unprocessed shot records dowloaded in the fetch 
	directory are displayed with and without nmo.  sftahsort is used
	to sort a few unprocessed midpoint gathers for comparison with 
	the processed midpoint gathers. 

        Perhaps the tahnmostack SConstruct whould be divided.  May move other 
	portions, like qc and preprocessint the npr3_field.rsf, into 
	another direcory.

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahsubset
	This directory extracts a subset of the data to test prestack 
	interpolation - the data is iline,xline,offset.  (sx,sy) and (gx,gy)
	are in the trace headers and can be used to compute offsetx, offsety.
	The 3D loading information can be read using:
	cd $RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/fetch
	scons 3dload.rsf


$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahscscale
	apply surface consistant scaling to npr3_field.rsf
	need to modify Mtahscale to only compute scalars and seperate
	pass apply the scalars.  I think this will scale to larger
	3D surveys

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/nmostack
	seismic unix scripts to apply nmo and stack the prestack processed
	data.

I need to index other work previous done by Vladimir.  Zomig can also be
       indexed in this readme file
