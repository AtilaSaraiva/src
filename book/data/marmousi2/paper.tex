\section{Introduction}
The Marmousi2 dataset is an extension and elastic upgrade of the classic Marmousi model. It was created by Allied Geophysical 
Laboratories (AGL).  The Marmousi2 model has enjoyed widespread use and has been particularily insightful in amplitude versus
offset (AVO) analysis, impedance inversion, multiple attenuation, and multicomponent imaging.  AGL has publically released 
the data for reasearch use around the world.   

Table \ref{tbl:FILES} contains all the Marmousi2 files contained within the Madagascar repository.

\section{model}
The Marmousi2 model completely encapsulates the origional Marmousi model which was based on the Northern Quenguela Trough 
in the Quanza Basin of Angola.  Lithologies include sandstones,shales, limestones and marls.    

In total the Marmousi2 model is 3.5 km in depth and 17 km across.  The model contains 199 horizons which make the model 
stratigraphicaly more complex than its predecessor.  Additionally the water layer was extended to 450 meters.   

As Marmousi2 is an elastic model both shear and primary velocities must be defined across the entire model.  
Additionally a density model is included.  
The files \emph{vp\_marmousi-ii.segy}, \emph{vs\_marmousi-ii.segy}, and \emph{density\_marmousi-ii.segy} contain the velocity and 
density models for Marmousi2.  These three files all share the same data spacing and their headers should be formatted similarily.
This header format is shown in table \ref{tbl:modelHeader}

        n2=13601   &   o2=0 &   d2=1.249    &    label2=Position\ X  &  unit2=m &  \\
        \hline
\end{tabular}
}


The file \emph{marmousi2\slash model\slash SConstruct} is a SCons script that fetches the three model files (VP, VS, and Density), 
appends the header information as necessary and produces plots of the models.  This file is reproduced in table 
\ref{tbl:modelSConstruct} and the models themselves are shown in figures \ref{fig:vp}, \ref{fig:vs}, and \ref{fig:density}.

\section{Shots}
Three sets of data were collected over this model.  A near surface streamer survey, a vertical souding profile (VSP), and 
an ocean bottom cable (OBC) survey.  Several sets of shot records are included in the Marmousi2 repository; 
the "shear phone" data from the VSP found in \emph{obc\_div\_v\_\#.segy} and \emph{obc\_curl\_v\_\#.segy}, the 
streamer cable data found in \emph{surface\_p\#.segy} as well as multicomponent OBC data found in \emph{obc\_vx\_\#.segy} 
and\emph{obc\_vz\_\#.segy}.  Each of these files was split into components to make them more managable and the segments must be
concatinated.  The  \# symbol above corresponts to either part number 1 or 2. 

In all cases the source was an airgun located on a ship at depth of 10 m.  The source began firing at 3 000 m along the horizontal x 
coordinate and continued firing every 25 m until 14 975 m.  

The streamers were spaced every 12.5 meters and were at a depth of 5 m.  The 

The streamer hydrophones 
were single component (naturally) and recorded only pressure.  The VSP was located at 10300 meters in the x direction and extended to a depth of 3500 meters with 12.5 
meter "shear phone" spacing.

\subsection{OBC Surveys}
The OBC cable was placed on the ocean floor at a depth of roughly 450 m.  Multicomponent phones were spaced every 12.32 m along the
entire length of the model.  As the model is 2D only the x and z components of the wavefield were measured.  
Marmousi2 OBC survey data should have header information configured as shown in table \ref{tbl:OBCheader}.

\begin{tabular}[t]{|llllll|}
        \hline
        n1=2500    &   o1=0     &   d1=0.002    &    label1=Depth\ Z     &  unit1=s  &  \\
        n2=1381    &   o2=0     &   d2=12.32    &    label2=Position\ X  &  unit2=m  &  \\
	n3=480 	   &   o3=3000  &   d3=25	&    label3=Shot-Coord   &  unit2=m  &  \\
        \hline
\end{tabular}
}


\subsubsection{OBC Vz data}
The file \emph{marmousi2\slash vz \slash SConstruct} contains a SCons script that fetches the Vz component
data files from the OBC survey, concatinates the segments, appends the header making a 
three axis file, (time, offset, and shot) and produces several plots of the data.  This file is reproduced in table 
\ref{tbl:VzSConstruct}.

\subsubsection{OBC Vx data}
Similar to the Vz data the file \emph{marmousi2 \slash vx \slash SConstruct} contains a list of rules that tell
Madagascar to gather the Vx data files, append the header and produce plots of the data.  This script is reproduced 
in table \ref{tbl:VxSConstruct}

\subsection{Streamer Surveys}
The streamer survey was not traditional in the sense that it employed a 17 km long static streamer which spanned the entire
model.  In total there were 1 361 single component hydrophones spaced every 12.5 m at a depth of 5 m.  This unrealistic geometry
was chosen both for simplicity and to allow maximum utility of the data.  The table \ref{tbl:streamerHeader} outlines the 
values that streamer data files headers should have.

        n2=1361    &   o2=0     &   d2=12.5     &    label2=Position\ X  &  unit2=m  &  \\
	n3=480 	   &   o3=3000  &   d3=25	&    label3=Shot-Coord   &  unit2=m  &  \\
