\section{Introduction}
The Marmousi model was created in 1988 by the Institut Fran\c{c}ais du P\'{e}trole (IFP) in 1988.  The geometry of this model is based on a 
profile through the North Quenguela trough in the Cuanza basin. The geometry and velocity model were created to produce complex seismic data 
which require advanced processing techniques to obtain a correct earth image. The Marmousi dataset was used for the workshop on practical 
aspects of seismic data inversion at the 52nd EAEG meeting in 1990.

Since its inception in 1990 Marmousi has come be a sort of industry standard and almost classic dataset. The Madagascar repository contains 
the Marmousi files shown in table \ref{tbl:FILES}.

\section{Model}
The Marmousi model contains 158 horizontally layered horizons.  A series of normal faults and resulting tilted blocks complicates the model towards its center.  The model sits under approximately 32 m of water and is 9.2 km in length and 3 km in depth.  

The velocity model found in the Madagascar repository, \emph{marmvel.hh} can easily be displayed.  This grid contains 751 data points in the Z direction and 2301 data points in the x direction.  Table \ref{tbl:modelHeader} displays the proper header configuration.

\begin{tabular}{|llllll|}
        \hline        
    n1=751    &     d1=.004   &        o1=0  &        label= Depth     & unit1=km &  \\ 
    n2=2301   &     d2=.004  &        o2=0  &        label2=Position  & unit2=km &  \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
}

The script found at \emph{marmousi/model/SConstruct} was written to obtain the Marmousi model datasets, append the headers as necessary and display the  data.  This file is presented in table \ref{tbl:velSConstruct} while the velocity model image is displayed in figure \ref{fig:marmvel}.

Typing command \ref{eq:SCmdl} within the \emph{Marmousi\slash model} directory runs the script.

\section{Shot Records}
The file \emph{marmrefl.hh} contains the shot data collected on the Marmousi model.  The survey was an off end survey with receivers to the left of the source being pulled towards the right.  Receiver as well as shot spacing is every 25 meters.  Near offset is 425 meters from the source.  726 time gates were recorded with 4ms spacing for roughly 3 seconds of data collection.  Madagascar correctly converts this file according to its header, but the correct shot header values are reproduced in table \ref{tbl:shotHeader}.

	\begin{tabular}{|llllll|}
	\hline  
	    n1=726 &  d1=0.004 &  o1=0     &  label1=Depth\ Z   &   unit1=sec     & \\
    	    n2=96  &  d2=-25   &  o2=2575  &  label2=Offset     &   unit2=meters  & \\
            n3=240 &  d3=25    &  o3=3000  &  label3=Shot-coord &   unit3=meters  & \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
}

The file \emph{marmousi/shots/SConstruct} gathers shot data, appends the header as necessary and produces several plots of the data.  This file is reproduced here in figure \ref{tbl:shotSConstruct}
