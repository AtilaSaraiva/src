Cant12 directory contains the workflows used to process marine seismic Line 12
from the data set of the Canterbury Basin, New Zealand using Madagascar. Some
processing jobs required access to Ranger (32 GB of RAM and 16 cores per node)
at Texas Advanced Computing Center at UT. Therefore, some directories will 
have a job file beside the SConstruct file .

The list of sub directories with a brief description of the purpose of each

- SEGY     : To read SEGY files and create shot.rsf file.
- shot     : To pick sea floor time and create shot.rsf and shot0.rsf.
- cmp      : To sort SHOT gathers into CMP gathers.
- decon    : To apply predictive deconvolution; the result was not used in 
             other processing workflows.
- interp   : To interpolate shots using PWD method; the results was not used
             in other processing workflows.
- srme     : To predict surface related mutliple energy using the algorithm
             described in (Dragost 1998).
- lpf      : To adaptively subtract the predicted mutliples using regularized 
             nonstationary regressions introduced by Fomel (2007).
- vel      : To automatically pick stacking velocities from demultipled data
- stk0      : To create nmostk.rsf and dmostk.rsf from cmp/cmp.rsf; CMPs before
             demultiple
- stk      : To create nmostk.rsf and dmostk.rsf after demultiple
- stkdemul : To apply poststack demultiple using SRME and regularized 
             nonstationary regressions
- velcon   : To estimate migration velocities using both velocity continuation 
             (fomel 2003) and path integral (Burnet and Fomel 2011) methods on
              diffraction data 
- mig      : To generate conventional migrated section and migrated 
             diffractions section using Kirchhoff migration in dip-angle 
             gather domain.
