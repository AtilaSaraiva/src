\title{Homework 3}

\begin{abstract}
This homework has two parts. In the theoretical part, you will derive
analytical reflection traveltimes using Fermat's principle. In the
computational part, you will experiment with numerical traveltime
computation methods and measure their accuracy.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Start by running
\begin{verbatim}
> cd ~/geo391
> svn update
\end{verbatim}

\section{Theoretical part}

You can either write your answers on paper or edit them in
\verb#~/geo391/hw2/paper.tex#. Please show all the mathematical derivations that
you do.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider...
