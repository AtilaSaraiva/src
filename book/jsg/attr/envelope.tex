If $s(t)$ is the input seismic trace, then the analytical trace is defined as the complex-valued signal 
\[
a(t) = s(t)+i\,h(t)
\]
where $h(t)$ is the Hilbert transform of $s(t)$:
\[
h(t) =\displaystyle \frac{1}{\pi} \int \frac{s(\tau)}{t-\tau} d\tau\;.
\]
The signal envelope is  the positive signal
\[
e(t)=\sqrt{s^2(t)+h^2(t)}\;.
\]
A phase-rotated seismic signal is 
\[
p(t)=s(t)\,\cos{\phi} +h(t)\,\sin{\phi}
\]
where $\phi$ is the phase of rotation.
