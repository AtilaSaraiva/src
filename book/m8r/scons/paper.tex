\chapter{Managing processing flows using SCons}

There are several options for doing data processing using Madagascar:
you can run programs on the command line, you can collect a sequence
of commands in a Shell script or a Python script. A superior
alternative, as this chapter explains, is to use a workflow management
tool, such as SCons.

\section{What is SCons?}

SCons stands for \emph{Sofware Construction} and is a tool designed
primarily for compiling software \cite[]{scons}, as a modern
replacement for the Unix \texttt{make} utility \cite[]{make}. The
SCons configuration files (\texttt{SConstruct} scripts) are written in
the Python programming language.

SCons is a tool traditionally used for compiling programs. An \texttt{SConstruct} file for compilation may look like the following
\lstset{language=python,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,showstringspaces=false}
\begin{lstlisting}
env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPFLAGS=['-Wall','-g'])
env.Program('hello',['hello.c', 'main.c'])
\end{lstlisting}
and produce something like
\begin{verbatim}
bash$ scons -Q
gcc -o hello.o -c -Wall -g hello.c
gcc -o main.o -c -Wall -g main.c
gcc -o hello hello.o main.o
\end{verbatim}
to compile the \texttt{hello} program from the source files \texttt{hello.c} and \texttt{main.c}.

Madagascar uses SCons to compile its programs from the source. The
more frequent usage, however, comes from adopting SCons to manage data
processing flows.

\subsection{Useful SCons options}

The \texttt{scons} program takes a number of options. Some of the commonly used options are:
