\chapter{Parallel processing in Madagascar}

Modern computers provide parallel computing facilities in the form of
either multiple processing units on one node or multiple distributed
nodes in a cluster. By taking advantage of parallel architectures,
many computational tasks can be significantly accelerated.

A particularly simple yet practically important case is \emph{data
  parallel} algorithms, where the input data can be split into
parallel chunks, processed in parallel by serial algorithms and then
accumulated back into one data stream. Madagascar provides a number of
convenient tools for running serial code into a data parallel fashion
without the need to resolve to low-level programming.
