\chapter{Python interface to Madagascar}

Python is a highly popular scripting programming languages. It is used by Madagascar in several contexts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Like many other languages, Python can be used for writing Madagascar ``filter'' programs.
\item Python is used by SCons, the preferred Madagascar way of
  managing data analysis workflows. SCons scripts (\texttt{SConstruct}
  files) are written in Python and can use the full power of the
  language.
\item Python can also be used for convenient scripting of operations
  with RSF files and Madagascar programs. This is particularly
  convenient for interfacing with other standard Python packages for
  data analysis.
\end{enumerate}
This chapter focuses on the latter case.
