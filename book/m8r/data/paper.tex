\chapter{Seismic data processing}

Although core Madagascar programs are applicable for analyzing any
kinds of data, there also programs specialized for seismic reflection
data processing. In this chapter, we will walk through processing one
particular dataset. Multiple additional examples are available under
\texttt{\$RSFSRC/book/data} and \texttt{\$RSFSRC/book/geo384s}. The
latter contains computational assignments from a seismic data
processing course at the University of Texas at Austin. An example
processing of a seismic land 3D dataset (Teapot Dome) is provided by
\cite{oren2018overview} and included in
\texttt{\$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/canoren}.
