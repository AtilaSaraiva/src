\chapter{Migration Gallery}

In seismic imaging, multiple algorithms exist for performing the task
of seismic migration. The algorithms differ in accuracy and
efficiency, which suggests a case for comparison. There are also
multiple known synthetic benchmarks for comparing different imaging methods.

The migration gallery project was born at the first Madagascar
\emph{working workshop} in
2013\footnote{\url{https://reproducibility.org/wiki/Austin_2013}}. The
main idea was to organize examples of multiple algorithms in the form
of a matrix, where rows would represent different benchmark examples
and columns would represent different migration algorithms. This
arrangement make it convenient to make direct comparisons of either
efficiency or accuracy wnen new algorithms are developed or previously
developed algorithms are tried on new data examples.

\section{Gallery project}

Example workflows from the migration gallery are organized by dataset
and located in \texttt{\$RSFSRC/book/data} directory. Thus, each data
directory serves as a chapter in the ``migration gallery'' book.
