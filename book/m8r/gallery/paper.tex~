\chapter{Migration Gallery}

In seismic imaging, multiple algorithms exist for performing the task
of seismic migration. The algorithms differ in accuracy and
efficiency, which suggests a case for comparison. There are also
multiple known synthetic benchmarks for comparing different imaging methods.

The migration gallery project was born at the first Madagascar \emph{working workshop} in 2013\footnote{\url{https://ahay.org/wiki/Austin_2013
