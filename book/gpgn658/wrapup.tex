\[ \texttt{cd} \sim\texttt{/gpgn302/hmwk09/\thisdoc/example} \]
and modify the \texttt{SConstruct} according to the assignment. Then
run 
\[ \texttt{scons view} \]
 to view all figures or 
\[ \texttt{scons myfig.view} \]
to view the figure named \texttt{myfig}.

When you are satisfied with your figures, run 
\[ \texttt{scons lock} \]
to lock all your results. Then 
\[ \texttt{cd ..} \]
 (this brings you in the directory
\texttt{$\sim$/gpgn302/hmwk09/\thisdoc}) and run
\[ \texttt{scons handout.read} \]
to read (and print) your homework. Please remove from the handout file
all the instructions (e.g. this section) and leave only the questions
and your answers.
