This directory contains simple API tests and examples that are
referenced in http://rsf.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/API . Besides
testing whether APIs work as expected, it has the purpose of providing
tests and examples for people who want to use RSF API but not
necessarily from inside RSF (i.e. somebody developing another package
but wanting to interface with RSF I/O). The purpose of the ".exe"
extensions (unusual for Unix) is to distinguish local programs from
programs with similar names that might exist in the environment.
